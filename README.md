The Google Developer Group Buea ( GDG Buea ) is a #techosystem of electronic enthusiasts and technically-minded hobbyists which grooms hackers, entrepreneurs and researchers by creating an anti-authoritarian culture where Google's products are employed to solve local technical problems. Our services come in the form of seminars such as Hour Of Code for Secondary/High Schools, Google Summer Of Code Meet-Ups for University Students, Google Cloud Developers Challenge Code labs for freelance developers, Android & Polymer Hackathons, etc. 

HISTORY

GDG Buea kicked off by having the its organizers be the first participants in the 2013 Google Summer Of Code from francophone Africa and got to document code for open source organizations like BRL-CAD, OpenMRS and Gnome in Mountain View, CA. In October 2013, they worked with GDG Yaounde and the Google Student Ambassador for the Higher National Engineering School to encourage over 200 students to participate in the Google Cloud developers Challenge. GDG Buea presented at talk on Open Source Development at the at the Open Collaboration Lounge during the 2013 Barcamp Cameroon to inspire their peers to go beyond writing code to documenting code. After launching the 2013 Google Cloud Developers Challenge (GCDC) by organizing Code Labs where various teams submitted apps, the TranSearch App was selected for the finals of GCDC 2013. To grow more techies using Google's technologies locally, they partnered with lecturers from local Universities like Catholic University Institute Of Buea and University Of Buea to organize weekly Hours of Code where students ameliorated their coding skills and become excellent Software Engineers. Finally, GDG Buea sensitized over 700 students of the University Of Buea and its administrators about student opportunities at Google during the Google Open Day. In 2014, we encouraged girls to participate in the 2014 Google Summer of Code program and two of our girls got selected for the 2014 GSoC program. We also worked with the Department of Computer Science during the Computer Science For High School workshop.
